**Abstract:** GP-MRAC extends BKR-CL to incorporate Bayesian estimation
through Gaussian process regression. Like BKR-CL, it is fully
data-driven and starts with the zero function (i.e., an empty kernel machine)
and builds up the learnt representation with data collected during
online operation. Combining machine learning analysis methods with
controls-based Lyapunov stability analysis leads to proven stability of
the method.
