**Abstract:** BKR-CL describes an adaptive control technique employing
machine learning tools and analysis to prove stabilization of a
neuro-adaptive control system that learns the network structure online
and in real-time. As part of the analysis, we observe that persistent
excitation of the neural network is not equivalent to persistent
excitation of the states.  The observation is used to define an online
network restructuring technique that ensure good approximation
capabilities given an upper bound on the network size.  Lyapunov methods
prove stabilization of the neuroadaptive control technique.
